# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Nathan!

With over a decade of experience as a public school music educator, I have strong interpersonal and communication skills, and am a lifelong learner who meets deadlines by delivering high-quality products. I am interested in creating practical solutions to everyday problems, and am looking to contribute to a team that prioritizes community while continually striving for excellence.

Approaching programming problems with the same determination and grit that led to me performing in Carnegie Hall twice.
